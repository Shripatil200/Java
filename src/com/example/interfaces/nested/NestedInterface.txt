Nested Interface:


Generally it is declared to group, logically related interfaces and nested interfaces.


There can be two types of nested interface:
1) Interface inside another interface.
2) Interface inside another class.

Interface inside interface:
    -Inner interface must be public.
    -We can create reference using OuterInterface.InnerInterface

Interface inside class:
    -Inner interface can have any access modifier (public, private, protected, default).
    -We can create instance using OuterClass.InnerInterface.

Note: When you implement outer interface, inner interface implementation is optional and vice versa.
