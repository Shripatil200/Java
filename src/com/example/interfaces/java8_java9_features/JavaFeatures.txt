Java8 and Java9 features:

Java 8 features: default method , static method.
java 9 features: private static method, private method.


Why default introduced:

case: suppose we have an interface implemented by multiple classes.
      and now we want to add a new method to that interface,
      which is working on same logic in every implemented class.
      if we create an abstract method we have to override it,
      in every implemented class. which will cost extra recompilation cost.
      to avoid this case java developer came with an idea of default method.
      we simply create a method with default modifier and add implementation to it.
      and because of inheritance all implementing classes inherit it.
      so we don't have to make change in every class.
      we can also override it and give specific logic if required.
