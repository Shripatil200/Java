ENUM :
-it is an actual class;
-It has a collection of CONSTANTS (variables which value can not be changed).
-It's CONSTANTS are static final implicitly.
-It can not extend any class, as it internally extends java.lang.ENUM class.
-It can implement interfaces.
-It can have variables, constructor, methods.
-It can not bew initiated (as its constructor will be private only, even given default, in bytecode it make it private).
-No other class can extend ENUM class (because its final by default).
-It can have abstract methods, and all the constants should implement that abstract method.
