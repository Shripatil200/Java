Singleton Class:

there will be  scenarios where you think there should be only one instance of a class -  such as class that create connection for database.

There shouldn't be more than ONE instances of a class

there are multiple ways to create singleton classes :

-Eager Initialization
-Lazy Initialization
-Synchronization Block
-Double Check Lock(there is a memory issue, resolved through instance variable)
-Bill Pugh Solution
-Enum Singleton(default singleton - as JVM have only one copy(snapshot))
